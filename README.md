## The Repository
This is the repository of the first A-line car in the [`S(car)lett`](https://github.com/sesame0707/S-car-lett) project.

## High-Level Goals
Those are the initial goals of this module:
- The use of mechanical mechanisms implemented in the LEGO 8070 set
- Design focused on easy disassembly and assembly (reusable design)
- The use of more expensive, but desirable components instead of cheaper, but weaker ones

All of the above goals have been achieved throughout this module's implementation.

## Results
The car looks as follows:

It has some custom and standard electronic parts in it. The real photos of them can be accessed in the `Pictures/Real photos` folder. For the standard parts, refer to the table of parts that can be found in the `Documentation/General` folder. Moreover, this model also incorporates 3D-printed parts, which can be accessed in the `3D printed parts` folder.
